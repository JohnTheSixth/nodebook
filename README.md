# Node Book

This repo is my work as I follow along in Manuel Kiessling's [Node Beginner Book](http://www.nodebeginner.org/).

Also included is a bunch of my messing around with random JS stuff that I think will make things better, but is probably unnecessary (like `use strict` for ES6 syntax).

The book is a great intro to Node.js, and I recommend anyone wanting to learn the basics of building a Node application [support the author and buy it](https://leanpub.com/nodebeginner).

To read the PDF, I recommend [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/) if you're on an Apple machine. It's free, the interface is simple, it's built for Apple, and it's got a lot of functionality.
